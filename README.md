### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Use different colors for each bar in the histogram.
- Add a button to refetch/regenerate the data (the endpoint will return random numbers each time).
- On hovering over a bar in the histogram, change the color and show a label above the bar with the precise value.
- Input their preferred range of number
